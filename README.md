## Project Overview

This project is divided into two parts, both aimed at applying core predictive modeling techniques to real-world datasets.

### Part A: Computer Activity Prediction (Regression)
- **Objective**: Predict the percentage of time a computer remains in **user mode**.
- **Method Used**: Linear Regression.
- **Purpose**: Analyze system performance based on resource usage metrics.

### Part B: Women’s Contraceptive Use Classification
- **Objective**: Classify whether women use contraceptives or not.
- **Methods Used**: Logistic Regression, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART).
- **Purpose**: Understand demographic and social factors influencing contraceptive use.

## Skills & Techniques Covered

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- CART (Classification and Regression Trees)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.)

## Datasets Used

- **Computer Activity Dataset** – Used for regression modeling.
- **Contraceptive Method Choice Dataset** – Used for classification modeling.
